"""
Hangman Game : This program is a version of the classic letter guessing game called Hangman. You are shown a number of letter letters that match a word and you have to guess what these letters are to reveal the hidden word. You guess by picking letters from the list displayed. If you pick a letter that is in the word, a letter is revealed from the blank letters; however, if you pick a letter that is not in the word, then a stickman starts slowly drawn. With each wrong letter guess, the man is drawn more and more. After 6 wÂ®ong attempts, he is hung and the game is lost.If you can reveal all the letters in the word before the man is hung then you are successful and the full word is revealed.
